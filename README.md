COMP.CS.310 Rinnakkaisuus / Concurrency -- Spring 2023.


This repository contains the following directories
(that is, each project has its own work directory):

  * Directory : project-1

    - Copy the [public example code](https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/comp.cs.310-rinnakkaisuus-concurrency_2022-2023/public/-/tree/main/project-1)
      and familiarize how the code works (a single thread implementation). 

    - Compile and run using QtCreator ( open rinn-2023.pro in QtCreator ).

    - Design and implement a multithreaded version of the code.

    - **Document** all the changes made to the original code 
      (Either separate document or clear comments in the code).

**REMEMBER TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK IN PLUSSA!**
Saving your files to course-gitlab is NOT enough, you'll have to
submit your work to plussa before the deadline of each project
(instructions in plussa).

Files related to the voluntary project must be saved to directory
called project-3 ( create it yourself if you do that project ).
